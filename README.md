Password Encryption: User passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database.
Session Management: Secure session management practices were employed to protect user data.
5. Testing and Deployment
Testing: The website underwent thorough testing for functionality, security, and performance across various browsers and devices.
Deployment: Finally, the website was deployed on a web server with PHP and MySQL support, ensuring that it is accessible to customers online.

7. Conclusion
The flower shop website is a fully functional, secure, and user-friendly platform that effectively meets the needs of both the business and its customers. With the integration of PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, the website provides a seamless shopping experience, robust backend functionality, and efficient management of products and orders. The project demonstrates a successful implementation of a full-stack web application for an e-commerce platform.
